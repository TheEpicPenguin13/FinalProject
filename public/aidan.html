      Aidan Metcalfe - The Front-End Programer of This Website - specializes in HTML and CSS as well as Javascript. His enjoyment of programing and other STEM topics originated from his obsession of technology and the internet. His experience in programing was very light until he got into the Berkeley High School Intro to Computer Programing Course.
