          To make this website we had to complete several tedious and advanced computing/coding steps.

      </p>

      <p>

          The hardest part of the project was seting up the communication between our website and a speadsheet. This took a whole week of our time and took all of our coding knoledge to sucessfuly do.

      </p>

      <p>

          Our code consisted of HTML + CSS to make the website and navigation itself, javascript to make our game WAVES which is the featured piece. Finaly we used Python to link the communication between our game and the spreadsheet that is connected to the leaderboard.
